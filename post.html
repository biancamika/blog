                    <p>Humanity may be the most advanced race on the planet, but does this mean our morals are up to par? This is one of the questions that was brought up when Marco Evaristti revealed his controversial exhibit “Helena & El Pescador”. Instead of a typical painting or sculpture, what he presented were ten blenders with live goldfish inside of them. The visitors had the choice to either press the button of any blender (and in doing so, kill the fish inside) or leave it alone. How was such a moral travesty allowed to be presented in a museum? Is this piece allowed to be considered art?</p>

<p>An artwork is not defined by its amount of detail or "Instagrammable" look. According to the Oxford dictionary, the definition of art is “the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination”. So yes, at first sight, the critics are right; there is a lack of aesthetics. After all, it's all just a big show of blenders with fish in them, right? However, if we study further the Value Theory,  this exhibit still serves importance to some people due to its use of ethics.</p>

<p>If this exhibit is art, it could be evaluated by certain criteria known as an aesthetic theory. This piece would do well if emotionalism and instrumentalism were applied to it. Emotionalism is all about communicating feelings to the audience, with examples such as social issues. Meanwhile, for Instrumentalism, the message is vital for success, since its goal is to influence society. The exhibit was able to make use of both of these theories since it proved this message: the power of humanity over all other species. This was shown by evoking feelings of anger, guilt etc. in the audience; by giving them the choice to push the button or not, it was demonstrated that anyone is capable of killing no matter what good they can do.</p>

<p>Despite its cruelty, the exhibit is an example of human creativity; it’s a feat to be able to send an important message with such unconventional materials (i.e. blender). Therefore, with this definition, it is considered art. However, there's a question that remains unanswered; is endangering innocent lives justified in the name of art? That's left for us, the audience, to answer. Now, reader, where do your morals lie?</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
