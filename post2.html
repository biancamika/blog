    <article>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>To the world, she is an internationally renowned artist. To herself, she is just a gypsy. Pacita Abad’s achievements have all come from a desire to “paint the globe”, working in more than 80 countries as a a result. In a world where the great artists are mostly white men (Jones, 2015), having a woman of color (her race also another disruption) come to be globally recognized as one is a rare phenomenon – one the Philippines can be proud of. </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Beginning: A Blank Slate</h2>
                    
                     <p>Considering the immense talent she had, it is surprising to find out she started painting late; in her mid-20s, she sacrificed a lot (having declined a scholarship for law) just to pursue her passion. As a result, she was a blank slate. While her other classmates were drawing portraits and landscapes, she was just beginning to learn the basics of drawing, composition, and perspective. However, she reigned in one element: color. </p>
                     
                     <p> Her art style is similar to the nature of children’s drawings: colorful, abstract, and experimental.  Color would be the only thing constant in her work; aside from that, her canvas was constantly changing. She described her style herself:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>"I always see the world through color, although my vision, perspective and paintings are constantly influenced by new ideas and changing environments."</blockquote>
                    
                     <h2 class="section-heading">Reflection on Expression</h2>
                    
                    <p>I can relate to her need for something new. As one with a miniscule attention span, I cannot be interested in one thing for a long time. In my art, I am constantly jumping from one sketch to another; this lack of satisfaction could be called experimentation, like what you would find in Pacita Abad’s work.</p>

 					<h2 class="section-heading">The Continuation: Extroverted Exploration</h2>
                    
                  <p>When she finished school, the next place where she painted was her studio in Bangdalesh. However, she realized there was more action outside; the action in the streets would inspire her to come up with portraits, bazaars, and landscapes. Craving more, she continued this routine as she travelled this world, visiting countries like Sudan, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Yemen, the Dominican Republic, and of course, the Philippines.</p>
              
  				  <p>The people around her became her muses. In fact, as a woman of compassion, many of her paintings were sociopolitical, the subjects ranging from Cambodian refugees to Ninoy Aquino himself (technically his corpse). Not only did she bring attention to people’s woes; she even sought to help them. For instance, she became an immigration lawyer, with one reason being the plight of OFWs.  She was also generous, giving art workshops to tons of kids around the globe. She believed art was for everyone; if a woman who started learning in her 20s end up having numerous exhibitions in different countries, imagine what a kid can do!</p>
                  
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Reflection on Aspiration</h2>

                   <p>As an arts and design student, Pacita Abad’s development as an artist is inspiring; she went from zero to (literally a) hero. It gives me hope that no matter how bad you are at something, you can master it. I also admire her humility. Despite all the accolades she achieved, her most treasured one was the happiness of her audience. According to her, she felt like an ambassador of colors, always projecting a positive mood that helps make the world smile. Maybe one day, my art will benefit others and not just me. What helped Pacita achieve these was passion; hopefully, I can find it in myself.</p>
                   
                   <h2 class="section-heading">The Conclusion: A Lack of Appreciation</h2>
                   
                  <p> Despite all that Pacita Abad accomplished, why is she still not a National Artist? She fills all the criteria: being a Filipino citizen, having built a sense of nationhood with her paintings (especially the ones on the Marcos regime), having pioneered a new art style (“trapunto”), and being bestowed numerous awards, both local and international. What holds her back from receiving the title?</p>
                  
                  <p>I believe she still lacks this because of her gender – an example of the male dominance in the fine arts industry. Even if she’s already won an award meant for men only (“Ten Outstanding Young Men”) , it is hard to break such a barrier twice. When checking the list of National Artists for Visual Arts, one can see that all of the awardees are male. This is not only seen in the Philippines; of all the work in major permanent collections worldwide, only an estimated 5% is made by female artists (Cochrane, 2013).</p>
                  
                 <p>A certain type should not hog the spotlight; it is now time for it to shine on the world’s minorities.  This especially applies to this country. Like what Pacita Abad said:</p>
                 
                 <blockquote>“It is long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines is full of outstanding women”.</blockquote>
                 
                 <p>Even the amazing people can be underappreciated. Everyone, please open your eyes to them.</p>
