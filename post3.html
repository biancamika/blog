        <div class="container">

                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>No words can describe how blessed I am to be in Arts and Design. Not everyone gets to pursue his/her passion due to circumstances; I appreciate having a family who supports my talent. However, the world is not so nice. No matter how skilled you are at your craft, there will always be problems, whether they come in the form of malicious customers or judgmental critics.</p>
                    
<p>This is why I am thankful to have experienced “The Artist Is In: Conversations with Emerging Artists in the Philippines”, which was a talk with Armi Millare (singer), Anjo Bolarda (visual artist), and Ral Arrogante (sculptor). My first impressions of them were of respect; then, the people right before my eyes were seasoned professionals. Maybe they would be strict? Would they smile at all? I was anxious to find out.</p> 

<p>However, they turned out to be easygoing. No bad vibes could be sensed in their presence. When they spoke, no jargon was used; everyone could understand them. In the end, instead of being shy, I did not hesitate to ask questions. That is how approachable they were.</p>

<p>Each art discussed the aspects of his/her own industry in his/her own way. Armi Millare talked about being a performing artist: the responsibilities of each member in her band (“Up Dharma Down”), which go beyond playing instruments (e.g. marketing, public relations, etc.) Meanwhile, Anjo Bolarda discussed his personal projects, going beyond what he’s known for (painting/illustration) to talk about what he’s done in the field of performance art; I love how we went into detail, describing the story behind the product. Ral Arrogante also showed his creation as a sculptor, talking about his process: sourcing materials, putting them together (which can take at least a day), etc.</p>

<p>All of their words filled me with inspiration; they were motivating, making me believe that despite the stigma, artists still have a chance in the future. It is rare to get insight into professions that are normally discouraged due to uncertain financial support; after all, there are many cases of parents who dissuade their children from going into artistic fields. Now, at least I have an idea of what to do. I can apply these new learnings to my outlook in life: being persistent. If you really love what you do in life, money or fame will not be a motivation. Arts and Design may be a difficult strand, but the passion for creation makes it all so worth it. Thank you miss.</p>
