                    <p>Heneral Luna deserved better; not just the character Antonio Luna himself, but also the movie, a nationalistic masterpiece. In a society where shallow content sells, from showbiz love teams to multi-entry installments milking a celebrity, Heneral Luna was a breath of fresh air. After watching this, I was filled with a mix of emotions; there was awe, pride, and anger. The ending especially was the most infuriating; every Filipino would’ve wished for justice. This wouldn’t have happened without the movie’s inspiration, the titular protagonist himself.</p>
                  

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Heneral Artikulo Uno</h2>

                    <p>If there was one word to describe Antonio Luna, it would be “intense”. His allies would say he was what kept the army fighting together. For instance, he charged with his horse to attack the Americans, encouraging his fellow comrades to also run into the battlefield. His guts surprised the Americans, to the point that they considered him their main threat. Meanwhile, his enemies (mostly fellow Filipinos) complained that he was volatile; for instance, he was known by other soldiers as “Heneral Articulo Uno” for constantly using the titled rule to get his way: 
                      
                      <blockquote>“All who refuse to follow the general’s orders must be executed without a benefit of trial in court”.</blockquote>
                  
                  Either way, anyone could agree that he truly loved his country; everything he did was for the freedom (not the safety) of the Filipinos.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
