                    <p>Heneral Luna deserved better; not just the character Antonio Luna himself, but also the movie, a nationalistic masterpiece. In a society where shallow content sells, from showbiz love teams to multi-entry installments milking a celebrity, Heneral Luna was a breath of fresh air. After watching this, I was filled with a mix of emotions; there was awe, pride, and anger. The ending especially was the most infuriating; every Filipino would’ve wished for justice. This wouldn’t have happened without the movie’s inspiration, the titular protagonist himself.</p>
                  

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Heneral Artikulo Uno</h2>

                    <p>If there was one word to describe Antonio Luna, it would be “intense”. His allies would say he was what kept the army fighting together. For instance, he charged with his horse to attack the Americans, encouraging his fellow comrades to also run into the battlefield. His guts surprised the Americans, to the point that they considered him their main threat. Meanwhile, his enemies (mostly fellow Filipinos) complained that he was volatile; for instance, he was known by other soldiers as “Heneral Articulo Uno” for constantly using the titled rule to get his way: 
                      
                      <blockquote>“All who refuse to follow the general’s orders must be executed without a benefit of trial in court”.</blockquote>
                  
                  Either way, anyone could agree that he truly loved his country; everything he did was for the freedom (not the safety) of the Filipinos.</p>
                  

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Worst Enemies</h2>
              
              <blockquote>"Our greatest enemy is ourselves." - Antonio Luna</blockquote>

                    <p>However, not all Filipinos felt the same as him. One of his enemies, Buencamino, believed making peace with the Americans would lead to safety for the whole country. However, according to Luna’s beliefs, one thing wouldn’t be safe: the freedom of the Filipinos. “Bayan o sarili?” is the question raised here; according to Luna, the Filipinos’ close ties to their families is their biggest fault. We’d do everything to protect them from danger, but when it comes to protecting our nationhood, there’s a lack of courage. There was also Emilio Aguinaldo, the president at the time. He also aimed for the freedom of the Filipinos; he knew Luna could actually make that possibility true, which made him Aguinaldo’s most valued general. However, it wasn’t enough; he still prioritized his feelings, including his eventual grudge for Luna, which lead to his death. As a result, the Filipinos lost the war. He is the antithesis of the Filipino soldier.</p>
              
              <h2 class="section-heading">True Blood</h2>
              
              <p>Another character that struck me was Luna’s lover, Isabel. She’s someone who actually chose to serve her country over herself, even if that meant giving up on her romance with Luna himself. She knew their feelings wouldn’t work in the war (e.g. she told him “You’re married to war, and I’m just your mistress), so she made the logical choice. There was also Joven, the reporter. For me, his importance laid in what he represented: the Filipino youth, the hope of this county. Journalism is a dangerous profession; publishing a controversial truth could cost you your life. Despite that, Joven pursued the truth (for the publication), even going as far as interviewing Antonio Luna. We need more people like Isabel and Joven in this country.</p>
